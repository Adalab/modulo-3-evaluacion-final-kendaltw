This is an exercise to practice our React skills where we create a "Rick & Morty" character list with characters given to us through an Api.

We also created an input to filter tha characters by their names.

If you click on a character it will open in a new route and show some some more details about the character.

To run the website just type npm run dev at your Terminal.
